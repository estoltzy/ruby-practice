# Write a program that can translate these English sentences into Spanish
# * a good developer solves problems in small steps
# * a good developer executes code frequently
# * a great developer is a team player
# * a great developer is a good listener

# Expected behaviour
# The user is prompted to enter a sentence in English
# The program translates the sentence into Spanish
# And prints the translated sentence

# Example
# (prompt)     Enter a sentence in English:
# (user input) a good developer solves problems in small steps
# (output)     un buen desarrollador resuelve problemas en pequeÃ±os pasos

# NOTE: doing a really good translation would require the word order
# to be changed in some places. You're not expected to do that! :)
